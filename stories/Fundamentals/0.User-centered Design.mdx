# User-centered Design

When developing a product or service, we often tend to forget that in the end, it is the user who will be interacting with it. If all they can feel about using your product is frustration, I assure you, they will _not_ be coming back - just think about the last time you had to deal with a poorly designed product and how much you are willing to use it again. On the other hand, if the feelings that your product evokes are positive, the user will be more likely to return and recommend it to others. And this is _exactly_ what the user-centered design is all about.

## Definition

User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers try to ensure that users are at the center of each and every step they take during it. This means that the users' needs, wants, and limitations are taken into account at every stage of the design process, and as soon as possible. The goal of UCD is to create products that are not only usable but also useful, desirable, and accessible to the users, based on their needs and preferences.

It might seem a bit obvious at first, because _of course_ we create a product centered around users, right? But this gets especially tricky with the current way we, as company, design our products. First and foremost, the main source of information about the end user for us is (most of the time) product owner - they might have good knowledge about the users, but they are __not__ the users, they can have their own biases and misunderstandings about what is best for the product. That's why it is crucial to either involve actual users in the design process or at least try to gather as much information about them as possible. All of that data can be later used alongside the UCD principles to create something truly tailored to the users' needs - and all of the solutions have to be created to address specific user needs.

## Iterative approach

The UCD process is, by its nature, iterative. I don't think it's possible to create a perfect solution on the first try - and even if you manage to do it, it's great to actually get the feedback confirming it from the users. But, in the end, it's that cycle of understanding, designing and evaluating that makes the solutions truly great, and even if you do not have means to evaluate against real users, such an evaluation can be made even within the team that you are working with (you might be surprised by amount of insights generated by doing even a simple iteration like that!).

[Diagram for the process here]

The UCD process starts with __understanding the problem__ you are trying to solve and the context of user needs. In order to do that, you also (or first and foremost?) need to understand the users and their perspective on the problem - who they are, what do they want to achieve, why do they want to achieve this etc. Usually you'll try to get that information out of the product owner, but it's even better if you'll have a chance to actually talk with the real users!

Next step is to __specify the user requirements__: that should sound familiar to anyone in the BA field reading this! Basically, we take all of the information gathered in the first step and we try to convert it into a list of digestable (and implementable) requirements in order to pass that over to the development team.

Once the requirements are done, the developer team steps in and start to __design the solution__. Bear in mind that "development" means the usual meaning, which is programming, but also the work commonly associated with the "UX design", which is prototyping the solution and doing the UI design or, in simpler terms, "making it pretty". Not only that, but we want to do as much of the prototyping as possible *before* passing it to the proper development, simply because it's cheaper to change if necessary.

And finally, when the implementation is ready, the final phase of __evaluating the solution against requirements__ happens. During this phase the QA team makes sure that the solution produced by the development team fulfills the requirements produced in the second step, done via the usual software testing methods.

Everything mentioned here might sound very familiar to you, but here's where it gets interesting: this whole process, as mentioned in the beginning, is meant to be iterative. So, after making sure that the solution is true to the presented requirements it should also be tested with actual users to check whether it complies with good UX principles. Not only that, but _each step of the process is also iterative_! That means that it's worth consulting the users on each step of this design process, just so you can get the feedback as soon as possible - and the sooner you get the feedback, the less costly it will be to change the product. It is especially helpful with the prototypes made by UX designer, since user will be able to test on something that is meant to represent the finished product, but without the costs associated with _actually finishing_ the product!

## Summary

- User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process that focuses on the needs, goals, and behaviors of users to create products that are intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use.

- UCD involves understanding user needs, specifying user requirements, designing solutions, and evaluating the final product against user feedback.

- The UCD process is iterative, meaning that each step is repeated and refined based on user feedback and insights gathered throughout the design process.

- By following UCD principles and involving users in the design process, you can create products that are user-centric, accessible, and engaging, leading to a positive user experience and increased user satisfaction.
