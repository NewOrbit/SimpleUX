# User-centric Design

When developing a product or service, we often tend to forget that in the end, it is the user who will be interacting with it. If all they can feel about using your product is frustration, I assure you, they will _not_ be coming back - just think about the last time you had to deal with a poorly designed product and how much you are willing to use it again. On the other hand, if the feelings that your product evokes are positive, the user will be more likely to return and recommend it to others. And this is _exactly_ what the user-centric design is all about.
